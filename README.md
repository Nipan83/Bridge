# BarelyAvailable Resources InterRegion Distribuition GuidE (BRIDGE)

### Bridge is an application built as a part of the [Covid'19 Spaceapps Challenge](https://covid19.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/covid-challenges). With this application, we're trying to mitigate the impact of Covid'19 on UN Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs).

## Objective

To build a web application which can eradicate the food security problem in hard times like Covid'19 by using a ML Recommendation Engine. 

## Current Scenario

According to [USDA](https://www.ers.usda.gov), 11.1% of households were food insecure at least some time during the year 2018 which is roughly **36.4 million Americans**. On the contray, US has **897,400 (100 acres) of farmlands** and **2,023,400 number of farms as of 2019**, stated in a report by [NASS](https://www.nass.usda.gov). And according to another report, In 2018, Americans wasted around **30%-40% of the entire US food supply**. 

> To understand the scenario, let's google something -

### So what could be the issue?

**Connecting the dots based on the above statistics, one of the reason could be absence of a bridge to link the supplier and buyer in an optimized way leading to wastage of food at one region and food insecurity in another region.** 

And if this continues, by 2050 when the demand will be 60% higher than today, not to mention the scenario will get worse.

## What are we proposing to tackle this problem?
